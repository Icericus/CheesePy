# CheesePy

## A discord bot about cheese

Created this as a random project on the side while learning python.
I wont hand out the cheeselist.csv or the crawler I used to create it because legal reasons. (am currently waiting on an answer from cheese.com)

Update: Reworked the bot to work with Slash commands

## Commands

- **/random:** Outputs a random cheese.
- **/search:** you can search for a cheese by its id, if there's a match it shows the cheese, if there are multiple it shows a list of the matches.
- **/reload:** Reloads the csv file (blocked to the owner of the bot, was too lazy to work with permissions so it just checks the userid)

## How to install

To install this you'll need:

- the python modules py-cord and python-dotenv
- a .env file with the bot-token and the userid of the owner
- a cheeselist.csv-file in the order id;name;country;imagelink;weblink;description

Good luck, if you need help, write me on discord: Icericus#3141
