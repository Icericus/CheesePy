# CheeseBot

### A discord bot about cheese.

Created this as a random project on the side while learning python.
I wont hand out the cheeselist.csv or the crawler I used to create it because legal reasons.

## Commands:

**c!random (or c!r):** Outputs a random cheese.
**c!search (or c!s):** you can search for a cheese by its id, if there's a match it shows the cheese, if there are multiple it shows a list of the matches.
**c!reload (or c!rl):** Reloads the csv file (blocked to the owner of the bot, was too lazy to work with permissions so it just checks the userid)


## How to install:

To install this you'll need:
- the python modules py-cord and python-dotenv
- a .env file with the bot-token and the userid of the owner
- a cheeselist.csv-file in the order id;name;country;imagelink;weblink;description


Good luck, if you need help, write me on discord: Icericus#3141
